# BetterImageOverlay
**BetterImageOverlay** is a mod for the game Cities: Skylines that allows you to show and control an image over your terrain, so you can easily use it as a template for building your city.

The image has to be located at **"[Steam Skylines Folder]/Files/overlay.png"**.

BetterImageOverlay is an improvement over [ImageOverlay](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413748580&searchtext=image) that gives you more control over the image, allowing you to toggle, position, rotate and change the size of the picture.
